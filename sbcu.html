    <div class="title">Specialized Bicycles - SBCU</div>
    <p class="case-studies title_center">
      During my time at Specialized Bicycle Components I worked heavily on SBCU's - Specialized Bicycle Components University -
      textbooks. We were presented with older INDD files that needed to be restructured. We redesigned that layout, set up new style rules
      and also worked as copy editors. This process spanned about four, 100 + page books. Each class season SBCU sees hundreds of
      students from locations all over the country and the world. These students come from bike shops that are Specialized retailers.
      Classes include technical experience, community building and various other subjects.
